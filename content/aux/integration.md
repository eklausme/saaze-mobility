## Multi-Integrations, a lot of possibilities
Open E-Mobility is a turnkey software that supports different use cases. To make this possible, connectors and application programming interfaces (APIs) are available for connecting third-party software to facilitate their integration.

## Third-party
Open E-Mobility is compatible with multiple software as Analytics, expense management HR & ERP

## Car connector
Open E-Mobility gives you the possibility to connect with your car DATA

## Facilitating the usage of your charging infrastructure

Opening your infrastructure to the public may be a way to actively contribute to the energy transition or to generate revenues. Besides, in various countries, you may even need to connect your charging stations to a roaming platform such as Hubject, e-clearing.net, Gireve or others to obtain incentives for the installation of your charging stations network.

## Welcoming roaming drivers
__EV roaming__ enables electric vehicle drivers to access EV charging infrastructure worldwide. Gireve and Hubject are for example two prominent marketplaces in Europe that enable EV drivers to use your charging points directly with their own charging cards.
Open E-Mobility includes an integration that allows you to connect your infrastructure to such roaming platforms by simply adding your contract credentials (see the respective roaming platform conditions for the connection costs.)

## Paying with our mobile app via Stripe
Roaming platforms are a great way to be referenced in a larger network, still you may want to make your charging stations available to the public without connecting to such a platform

1. in order to provide better value for money charges and to lower your costs
2. An easy way without any additional hardware is to enable EV drivers to pay directly with their mobile application. For this purpose, the Open E-Mobility team has implemented an integration with Stripe.
Stripe is a payment processing platform that allows you to collect payments made via the mobile app into your Stripe account.

## Easy to use
The practical use case is as simple as follows:
1. you open a Stripe company account and link it to your bank account
2. you generate the QR codes directly in your Open E-Mobility account
3. you stick the stickers on your charging stations.
4. External EV drivers on their side enter their payment method in the Open E-Mobility App (available for iOS and Android in the App Store) and scan the QR code to start charging. At the end of the charging process, the amount is automatically paid and sent directly to your Stripe account while the EV driver can retrieve his invoice.

## Knowing your fleet to optimize the charges

### Manage different assets

Thanks to its smart charging capabilities, Open E-Mobility enables to manage different assets and implements sophisticated algorithms to match the energy demand with energy capacity in real time and to fast charge multiple vehicles in parallel.

However, Charge Point Management Systems (CPMS) may miss critical car information to fully optimize the charges: when a car is connected to an AC charging point, it does not receive the current state of charge (SoC) of the vehicle.

To solve this problem, Open E-Mobility leverages __car connectors__ that inform our software about the SoC of the vehicles. Car connectors can be software based and brand specific (in this case we connect directly to the cloud of the manufacturer, e.g. Mercedes), software based and brand agnostic (thanks to aggregators such as Tronity that offer a single API to connect with the main constructors including Tesla, VW, Renault, Stellantis, Kia, etc.), or hardware based (the SoC of your fleet vehicles are transferred to a private space accessible via our software).

## Integrating Open E-Mobility with your software landscape
Open E-Mobility is only one component of the enterprise software landscape, therefore, to make your day-to-day business easier, it must interact with other components to better understand the usage and the costs of the EV infrastructure and to make the employee experience transparent and easy.

### Integration with the ERP
Open E-Mobility enables you to display your infrastructure landscape across different companies and to assign EV drivers to a cost center. You can establish links with your ERP to link your devices with assets, assign the energy consumption to the cost center, link drivers with CRM Business partners and leverage your existing software to manage the financial side of your EV infrastructure.

### Human Resources and Payroll
Benefits in kind related to the employees’ energy consumption must be reflected in the respective employee payroll. The import of the figures can be automated for charging sessions occurring at company premises or at the employees’ house if you offer to supervise their charging points.

### Facilitating cost claim
Enabling employees to charge at home is a definite must-have to lower the stress on your company infrastructure, nevertheless employees shouldn’t lose time to claim their expenses.

Our integration with SAP Concur enables to create a cost claim with one click.

### Understanding your infrastructure usage
Open E-Mobility includes a set of basic analytics to understand your Infrastructure usage, however if you want to be able to further exploit your data, you can setup your favorite analytics tool to use Open E-Mobility as a data source.

## Another Integration Idea: leverage a full fledge API
We are completely aware of the fact that you may want to integrate Open E-Mobility to support other use cases and we are indeed working on others with commercial or research partners. Our full fledged REST API enables to collect and eventually interact with all data manipulated by Open E-Mobility such as companies, sites, site areas, charging points, assets, users, RFID cards, cars, sessions, billing and more!
