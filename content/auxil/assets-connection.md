Open E-Mobility allows you to interconnect charging points, buildings, energy production assets, and storage, independently of their hardware manufacturer.

With our solution, you can choose the equipment that best fits your needs.
Create the perfect experience
With more than 60 charging point manufacturers we have tested in our lab, you can choose the most appropriate mix without being limited to a specific brand in your future choices.

Open E-Mobility is not just a solution that optimizes and supervises your charging infrastructure â€“ we go further. Our holistic view allows you to integrate electricity production, storage, and consumption assets, giving you an overview of your entire network. This enables additional management opportunities such as corrections, early maintenance, or a reboot if required.
