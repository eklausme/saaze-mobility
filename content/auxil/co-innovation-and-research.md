While Open E-Mobility was literally born in a garage, we quickly realised that the energy transition was nothing without the right ecosystem: we leveraged our local and global partners network to co-innovate and to evangelize about the energy transition.

## CAPENERGIES
SAP Labs France is a proud member of [Capenergies](https://www.capenergies.fr/en/) and working regularly with organisations such as ADEME or IMREDD (that run Open e-mobility for their experimental setup). We are involved in research projects and integrated several results such as for example the smart charging component published in IEEE in the very heart of the solution.

## MOBENA
Innovation and research projects continue, and our team members are actively involved in the Mobena project.

The Mobena initiative was created in July 2020 by the main French professional organizations representing the electromobility ecosystem in the French market. The MOBENA Project focus is to ensure a successful deployment in the French market of the ISO 15118 services. Our goal is to make Open E-Mobility one of the first solution supporting Plug and Charge and smart charging ISO15118 standard.

As a first step we participated to the demonstration [E-mobility: a successful demonstration of the Certificate Trust List for Plug & Charge interoperability](http://www.vedecom.fr/e-mobility-a-successfull-demonstration-of-the-certificate-trust-list-for-plug-charge-interoperability/?lang=en)
