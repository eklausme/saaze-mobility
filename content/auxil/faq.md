1. _Hybrid vehicles are the best alternative for my trips and for the planet._

	Hybrid vehicles can offer more flexibility to some users with very high mobility needs. However, as far as CO2 emissions are concerned, hybrid vehicles are not an alternative to pure electric vehicles.

	The pollution measurements of plug-in hybrid vehicles are carried out in a laboratory. These tests are extremely unrealistic, as reported by the European organization " Transport &amp; Environment ".

	Once the battery is drained, it becomes a dead weight, which increases the vehicle's fuel consumption. For example, the BMW X5, which was tested in the laboratory with 32 g CO2 per km, actually consumes 385g CO2 per km under real conditions!

	If you want to buy a rechargeable hybrid vehicle to reduce your carbon footprint, you should think carefully about your usage pattern. (You can use the [CARBONCOUNTER](https://www.carboncounter.com/#!/explore) developed by the MIT Trancik Lab to compare your favorite models.)


1. _An electric vehicle pollutes more than an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICE car)._

	*That is true if you don't use your car, but wrong if you do!*

	It is true that CO2 emissions during the production of an electric vehicle are higher than for a combustion engine vehicle, but this is largely compensated during the vehicle life cycle. The exact number of kilometers is difficult to calculate, as CO2 emissions vary in the manufacture of a vehicle, its battery and its use, depending on production and material location and on the energy mix during usage.

	The Bloomberg article [The Lifecycle Emissions of Electric Vehicles](https://about.bnef.com/blog/the-lifecycle-emissions-of-electric-vehicles/) shows the results of a study of total CO2 emissions from combustion vehicles and electric vehicles produced in 2020 and driven for 250,000 km. The following graphic shows the CO2 emissions emitted during the construction of the vehicles, battery production, and usage.

	The lifecycle CO2 emissions of medium segment battery electric cars produced in 2020 and used for 250,000 km would be between 18% and 87% lower than those of equivalent internal combustion engine vehicles in the five countries included in this report. The breakeven point is far sooner in France at 25,000 km, compared to 153,000 km in China. By 2030, all countries will see this emissions breakeven point occur far earlier. *

1. _Batteries of electric vehicles are not recyclable._

	That is not true.

	The batteries of electric vehicles are mostly recyclable, but their components are mainly reused for other purposes.

	As the battery lifespan significantly exceeds the vehicle lifespan (more than 80% remaining battery capacity after 500 000 km!), they can initially be reused as storage batteries. Many options are possible. Batteries could provide a valuable service to the electricity grid in integrating so-called intermittent renewable energy sources (wind and sun). They could be used in different ways, for example, as a buffer battery or coupled with fast charging stations that need to deliver a large amount of energy in a short period of time.

	Such uses are already possible in Africa, where a [start-up implements so-called microgrids for remote villages](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/03/19/empowered-by-light-recycles-old-ev-batteries-for-microgrid-applications/), thus enabling them access to electricity.

	The Irish company EATON markets storage batteries made from batteries previously used in Nissan Leafs &ndash; [xStorage Home supports the energy transition](https://www.eaton.com/in/en-us/products/energy-storage/xstorage-home-supports-the-energy-transition.html).

	For the recycling of batteries, the European Regulation stipulates that the manufacturer must collect the batteries at its own expense, recycle them and cooperate with a recycling company whose procedure guarantees 50% recycling.

	Concerning the quantity of batteries to be recycled, the wide use of electric vehicles only starts. We won't have a large quantity of batteries to be recycled in 10 years.

	Nevertheless, manufacturers are already preparing for their position in this value chain, such as [Renault, which is joining Veolia and Solvay's recycling cooperation to work with them in developing a circular economy for metals from discontinued electric vehicle batteries.](https://www.veolia.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/groupe-renault-veolia-solvay-join-forces-recycle-end-life-ev-battery-metals)


1. _Charging an electric vehicle takes far too long!_

	This statement is false as this has drastically improved in recent years.

	Today, you can charge a mainstream EV so fast that you get about 250 kilometers within 30 minutes (e.g. with 50 kWh) or even less.*

	In the summer of 2021, the record was set by [Chinese car manufacturer GAC, that charges 200 km in 4 minutes](https://www.electrive.com/2021/08/22/gac-aion-v-charges-in-8-minutes/)!

	Also, how many times a year do you actually have to stop at a charging station? Do you know that by charging at a 230 V standard plug overnight you get more than 100 kilometers?

	*Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g97pqyGFixg) from one of our employees charging a Tesla Model 3 at our Mougins site in 30 minutes.


1. _There won't be enough lithium for all electric vehicles._

	This statement is false: Studies from 2009 to 2015 concluded that sufficient battery raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite are available for global electric mobility [16&ndash;19]. Global occurrences tend to significantly exceed forecasted demand, even if, for other application areas, the need for raw materials continues to increase through more demand.*

	*Fraunhofer ISI (2020): [Batterien fuer Elektroautos](https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/isi/dokumente/cct/2020/Faktencheck-Batterien-fuer-E-Autos.pdf): Faktencheck und Handlungsbedarf, p.13

	As interest in lithium is still relatively new, the results of quantifications are still changing greatly.

	The resources identified by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are a good example. Estimates of global lithium resources increased from 25.5 million tons in 2010 to 80 million tons in 2020. Reserve estimation nearly doubled from 9.9 million tons in 2010 to 17 million tons in 2020.

	It becomes clear that lithium resources are increasing as mining exploration progresses.

	LITHIUM &ndash; U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries (2020): [LITHIUM](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-lithium.pdf)

	In addition, battery researchers are already concerned with alternatives with no or less lithium, which have a greater energy density, are more durable, and allow faster charging.


1. _If we offer electricity as an employer benefit to employees and/or provide employees with private charging equipment and/or reimburse self-funded electricity costs, how can this be managed and taxed in payroll?_

	To encourage companies *to make their car fleets more environmentally friendly*, electric vehicles and the associated charging infrastructure are largely funded by the governments across Europe.

	The free or discounted charging of electric vehicles on site at the employer is usually tax-free if the employer provides the electricity as an additional benefit.

	Please read up on the information provided by the Ministry of Finance responsible for your country to find out about the laws that apply for your company.

	To manage benefits and taxation in payroll, the relevant data can be exported in CSV format from your Open E-Mobility space and integrated into your payroll software.


1. _What type of charging station should be installed?_

	_The charging station you choose must meet the needs of your company_. The nature of your business and the activities you perform influence your selection.

	If your employees have high mobility and have a lot of on-site customers or need to make many trips, it makes sense *to install one or more fast charging stations* (DC charger). With these, your employees can recharge their vehicles quickly and thus become mobile more quickly.

	If your employees are on site all day with low mobility needs, it makes more sense to install slow AC charging stations between 7 and 22 kWh for example. These charging stations allow employees to recharge their batteries gently throughout the working day.

	In general, we recommend creating a mixed charging infrastructure by including (slow) AC and (fast) DC charging stations to meet different requirements while reducing costs.


1. _What does a charging station cost?_

	The costs of a charging station depend on various factors, such as:

	1. the power delivered by the station. An AC charger provides less power and therefore also charges more slowly, but it also costs less. A DC charging station charges faster, but also is more expensive.
	1. the manufacturer of the charging station.
	1. the area of implementation of the charging stations (installation costs) and the potential upgrade of your electricity contract.

	Open E-Mobility allows you to *choose the manufacturer with the best price-performance ratio for you*, reducing the need for an electricity contract upgrade.


1. _I already have solar panels and now want to add charging stations for e-cars. How can your solution help me?_

	_Open E-Mobility allows you to connect all your electrical assets and supervise your complete charging infrastructure._

	For example, at our Mougins site, we manage a complete smart grid, which includes our solar panels (80 kW), a battery storage (150 kWh), our charging infrastructure (with a capacity of 1020 kW), and our building. This is possible thanks to Open E-Mobility and our partners.


1. _How can my employees know when their car is ready to be used?_

	Users of the charging stations can see the status of their charging process on their computer or smartphone using the Open E-Mobility App. When the optimal charging state is reached and when the charging process is complete, push notifications via smartphone or e-mail inform the user in real time that he can drive his vehicle away from the charging station and release it for the next one. With this system, the charging point is made available again as soon as the charging process is complete, thus helping to optimize its benefits and prevents the installation of too many expensive charging stations.


1. _When I install my charging stations, do I have to change my electricity contract?_

	No, this will probably not be necessary.

	The Open E-Mobility software integrates a Smart charging algorithm. _This algorithm adjusts the available power of the network according to the demand_.

	This means that if our algorithm detects too much utilization of your charging infrastructure, it decreases the power available at the individual charging points and thus ensures that the available electricity is distributed fairly and according to the defined priorities and avoids overloading the grid supply.


1. _Can I allow external EV drivers to charge at my charging stations and make payment transactions without being connected to a roaming platform?_

	Yes, you can.

	_The Open E-Mobility app available for iOS and Android_ integrates the Stripe payment platform. The end user enters his *payment method* and pays his charging costs directly to the Stripe account assigned to your company.


1. _Can I use Open E-Mobility to enable other users to use my charging points (e.g. roaming)?_

	Yes, you can.

	If you want to open your terminals for roaming, _several solutions are possible_. The roaming platforms allow you to sign roaming agreements with the different mobility providers, such as Chargemap, etc. These mobility operators will reference your terminals on their respective platforms/mobile apps, giving them increased visibility.

	In your Open E-Mobility Cloud Space, you can manage the different parameters related to the roaming platform as well as various statistics (usage of terminals by external users, inactivity rate of terminals by external users, etc.).


1. _I'm a business owner and want to install charging stations. What is the purpose of Open E-Mobility?_

	With Open E-Mobility, you can *monitor and optimize your entire charging infrastructure*. Your connected charging stations enable information to be sent to your Open E-Mobility Cloud Space.

	In the admin area, you can see the overall state of your infrastructure, which charging stations are connected/disconnected, access statistics of charging stations, users, and zones, view charging times, or check costs per user/station, per zone, etc.

	The Smart charging algorithm integrated in our solution enables to:

	1. _reduce your investment costs_ by optimizing the size of your charging infrastructure and preventing the installation of too many expensive charging stations.
	1. _optimize the energy managemen_t at your site(s).
	1. connect your existing or future energy assets (e.g. solar panels or batteries).
	1. optimize vehicle rotation at the individual charging points and thereby promoting their benefits and the best possible utilization.


1. _What are the different use cases supported by Open E-Mobility?_

	Open E-Mobility was born with the vision to:

	1. Enable a rapid transition to EVs and renewable energy
	1. Rethink the entire energy chain
	1. Reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) through AI and powerful algorithms

	The solution can therefore be adapted to many different uses. Users can be, for example, administrations, cities or private companies that *want to reduce the carbon footprint* of their citizens or employees, electricians or energy distribution networks that do not want to be tied to a single manufacturer or also want to install production and storage capacities, restaurants, supermarket chains or large commercial networks that want to offer new services to their existing customers and attract new ones.


1. _What are the key features and strengths of Open E-Mobility?_

	Open E-Mobility offers you the following:

	1. A hardware manufacturer-independent solution that is compatible with more than 50 different AC/DC chargers
	1. A versatile solution that supports multiple use cases and business models
	1. A ready-to-run software that supports the integration with SAP and third-party software
	1. Integrated roaming, payment, and billing capabilities that enable you to integrate your infrastructure into leading standards (e.g. Hubject, Gireve, Stripe, etc.)
	1. A scalable and highly available cloud-based software solution with an intuitive user interface
	1. A solution that is able to supervise an entire electric vehicle charging infrastructure (IRVE) together with a complete smart grid
	1. A solution developed almost 10 years ago and since then been used and tested daily at SAP Labs France's huge private e-car fleet (100% e-cars representing 300 company cars, 20+ EV brands, 3 main sites, and more than 60 satellites)


1. _Which charging points/wall boxes are compatible with Open E-Mobility?_

	Open E-Mobility is largely hardware-independent. The solution enables communication with almost all AC and DC charging stations that comply with the OCPP1.6 protocol. Since mid-2021, we have tested *more than 50 types of different manufacturers*, and the number is growing.

	If you are manufacturing charging stations, feel free to contact us to jointly test their compatibility with Open E-Mobility.


1. _What is the purpose of Smart charging in Open E-Mobility?_

	Open E-Mobility integrates a Smart charging algorithm developed by our researchers in Germany. This algorithm allows to:

	1. *smooth energy demand peaks.* If the algorithm detects too much utilization of your charging infrastructure, it lowers the power available at the charging points, allowing more cars to be charged at the same time with the same power at each charging point.
	1. *adjust the load distribution to priorities.* Users can be given priority within the charging infrastructure according to their vehicle state of charge. This prioritization can be done using many different parameters, such as the battery level of the vehicles, the specific autonomy requirements, or other defined parameters for the respective users.
	1. *optimize the charging costs of the vehicles*. Open E-Mobility provides the ability to establish charging plans, so charging starts when electricity costs are lowest during off-peak hours. Therefor, the day ahead electricity prices can be loaded and used in Open E-Mobility.


1. _What are the advantages of Open E-Mobility?_

	The Open E-Mobility solution offers many advantages, the most important ones are:

	1. *An agile management of complex energy infrastructures.* With Open E-Mobility, you can monitor the state of your charging infrastructure. For example, if a charging station is disconnected or a charging process is interrupted, notifications are automatically sent to the administrators. You can then, for example, reboot a charging station remotely without any on-site intervention.
	1. *A proactive user management to promote responsible behavior.* Open E-Mobility communicates directly with your users when their vehicle is charged. As soon as the charging process is complete, a notification is sent to the user via smartphone or e-mail so that he can drive his vehicle away from the charging station and release it for the next vehicle.
	1. *A holistic management of all users of your charging infrastructure from a single platform.* You can assign different roles and charging areas to your users where they can charge or not.<br />
You get accurate statistical information about how your users use the charging stations. This includes, for example, the inactive time per user, consumption in kWh, cost of charging sessions, time spent at the charging points, etc.


1. _What is Open E-Mobility?_

	Open E-Mobility is an *energy supervision and smart charging solution* and a holistic system for managing the charging processes of electric vehicles (CPMS &ndash; Charge Point Management System) in real time.

	With this solution, you can optimize the sizing of your charging infrastructure while meeting network constraints and keeping track of your entire charging infrastructure and users.

	*Easy monitoring of charging operations* at your charging stations enables efficient time management and optimized vehicle rotation at the individual charging points, optimizing their usefulness and preventing the installation of too many expensive chargers.

	At the same time, Open E-Mobility provides an *optimization of energy management *(Energy Management System). Several energy production assets (e.g. solar panels), battery storage, buildings (smart building), and different charging points can be integrated, independently of their hardware manufacturer.

	_Using the smart charging function_, an intelligent control balances load imbalances, avoids energy peaks, and thus minimizes electricity costs.

	All information can be sent to multiple SAP and third-party software applications to obtain accurate information about cost, usage, and consumption.

	These optimization procedures enable an efficient setup of charging infrastructures, improve their usability, and efficiently support the integration of e-vehicles into your business processes.
