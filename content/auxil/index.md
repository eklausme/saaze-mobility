## We are Open E-Mobility

Open E-Mobility allows you to efficiently supervise your entire charging infrastructure and e-fleet to best support EV drivers.

To fight the global climate issue and to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement (e.g. cut of 50% reduction of CO2 emission by 2030), we need to support the society to make the usage of electric vehicles easier, to optimize the use of the energy and to develop the production of sustainable energy.

With these goals in mind, we built Open E-Mobility. Since SAP Labs France took the courageous step to convert its company car fleet to 100% electric vehicles in 2014, we have been using Open E-Mobility daily and are constantly working on further developments.

Open E-Mobility is a driving factor so that any charging network, every company, every fleet manager, any shop or residential building can become an actor of this evolution by producing, storing and consuming energy. Open E-Mobility provides a simple and efficient way to supervise your charging infrastructure and to enable drivers to move to electric vehicles smoothly.


> ## [Energy Monitoring software](monitoring)
> Open E-Mobility allows you to supervise your entire infrastructure regardless of its complexity and to manage the drivers using RFID cards or our mobile app (Android / iOS).
> You can grant EV drivers access to different areas of your private or public charging network.
>
> Our solution can support different charging point types and brands, but also components for energy production or storage.
>
> [Read More](monitoring)

> ## [Smart EV charging](smart-charging)
> Open E-Mobility uses several sophisticated algorithms.
> Using our smart charging functions, Open E-Mobility monitors, manages, and adapts the use of charging points to optimize energy consumption while ensuring that your grid supply is not overloaded.
> In detail, this means that we smooth energy demand peaks so that more cars can be charged with the same power supply. We adapt the distribution of power (load balancing) according to priorities as battery level. We optimize charging costs by using off-peak prices.

> ## [E-mobility service enables assets connection](assets-connection)
> The core of Open E-Mobility provides connectivity with different charging point types – from slow AC chargers to DC fast chargers (Ultra Fast Charger) – of more than 60 manufacturers we have tested in our lab.
> A key differentiator to other solutions is our ability to connect with other components from the energy chain such as production (e.g. solar panels) or storage (e.g. batteries) and your smart building.
> In addition, Open E-Mobility can even manage complex infrastructures, including multiple companies, multiple sites, and charging areas.
> This connection of your assets allows you to control the access of your drivers.
>
> [Read More](assets-connection)

> ## [Full integration](integration)
> Open E-Mobility is a versatile solution that supports different use cases by providing connectors and application programming interfaces (APIs) to connect to third-party software and other SAP solutions.
> Roaming, payment, and billing capabilities enable you to integrate your infrastructure into a larger network (e.g. Hubject, Gireve) and carry out payment processing (e.g. Stripe).
> To closely monitor the costs of your infrastructure and its operations, a connection to your ERP system can be established and consumption and revenue linked to related suppliers.
> Employees can see the cost of their loads in real time. These costs can be linked directly to the employee’s payroll or claimed for reimbursement.
