### Smart charging enables cost-effective matching of energy demand with energy performance in real-time

### We have developed an algorithm that optimizes the charging quality with automatic control.

### Our Smart Charging algorithm enables

## Prioritize users energy needs

This prioritization allows a user with a low battery level and a more important autonomy requirement to get a higher charging capacity than another user who loads at the same time. This can be done either by an automatic transfer of information by the charging stations or by manual entry.

## Smooth the electricity demand

To avoid overloading the grid supply, the Open E-Mobility algorithm smooths possible energy demand peaks in your network. This means that if our algorithm detects high pressure on your charging infrastructure, it decreases the power available at the charging points, allowing more cars to be charged at the same time.

## Optimize the charging costs

Our Open E-Mobility solution provides the ability to establish charging plans. Charging starts when electricity costs are lowest. If your employees have a charging station at home, these vehicles can be charged during off-peak hours. This makes it possible to optimize your charging costs depending on your electricity tariff.
