We help you to understand and setup our e-mobility solution. Understanding the challenges of electric mobility will allow you to move forward and better manage your energy.

## Understanding the EV game changer
### Understanding the challenges of the energy transition
This training concerns all persons interested in understanding the challenges of the energy transition and the electrification of transport in general and company fleet. This training built on our know-how and lessons learned since almost 10 years and its content has been designed to provide a 360 degree view of the knowledge needed to make the right decisions and plan the transition in an informed way.

Starting from the fundamentals around energy and electricity production, we will analyse the daily use of electric vehicles with traditional ICE vehicles and give you the keys to understand the market offer.

### Business part
We will then move to the business perspective and analyse how you may want to leverage transport electrification to develop new services to your customers. After a brief review of the European Green Deal and national support to the transition, the national  political choices and their implications and the associated public aid.  We will study the types of infrastructure needed, the capabilities of a smart enterprise-ready supervision system and the actors involved in order to offer charging capacities but also to promote the production of renewable energy in order to reduce costs and accelerate decarbonisation. Finally, we will discuss the different aspects specific to the migration to an electric fleet (eg real life constraint, change management, TCO/ROI, HR, benefits).

### Electric vehicle transition road mapping
We share our experience
Do you need some help to define your transition to a best managed electric fleet ? While some legislation framework is forcing you to install infrastructure do you know how to best serve your employees and customers for the next ten years ? Hardware, installation cost, cars, infrastructure management but also software integration is needed to transform your fleet and to get your employees to embrace the changes. This service built on our know-how and lessons learned since we transformed the SAP Labs France to the first 100% EV fleet.

### With all car models and charging stations
With more than 1MW and 100 charging points (!) distributed across our sites and our employeeâ€™s homes, 6800+ charging sessions in 2021, circa 300 vehicles from Tesla, Kia, Hyundai, Jaguar, Volkswagen, Nissan, Ford, Renault, Peugeot, BMW, Volvo, Skoda, Mini, Mercedes, Audi, Aiways and an infrastructure combining energy production and storage, we can certainly support you to build the future of your fleet not only to reduce cost but also to boost your CO2 reduction.
