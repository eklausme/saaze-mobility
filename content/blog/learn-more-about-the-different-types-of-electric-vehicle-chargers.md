Electricity, oil and gas suppliers, as well as players in the automotive industry and independent operators, are all rushing into the same market. The market for charging electric vehicles.

All these companies are trying to grab their piece of the cake by redoubling their ingenuity to differentiate themselves but also by proposing solutions that will bring comfort to users during recharging. Recharging at home, at work, or on the road is now a well-accepted behavior.

The positioning of companies in these different areas leads to different behavior and recharging needs. Thus, slow AC charging, but also fast DC charging and ultra-fast charging also reflect different uses and needs thanks to the power available for EV charging.

In this article, we will look at the different types of terminals and understand what is behind the acronyms AC, DC, and ultrafast.

## The different types of ev charging charger
The slowest, the AC terminals for those who like to take their time

These stations are generally used at home, in condominiums or in companies. These stations are located where the charging priority is not very high. Thus, the driver can take his time to charge his vehicle. On average, these stations recharge a vehicle in 5 to 7 hours. The AC terminals deliver an alternating current which is converted into direct current (DC) to supply the battery.

Fast DC charging, Ultra-fast for those in a hurry
## Fast DC charging
Fast DC charging is the first of the three ways to “quickly” recharge an electric vehicle. In less than 30 minutes, it can recharge a car’s battery to nearly 80% and therefore quickly obtain a range of more than 120km.

Fast DC charging uses an AC/DC current converter that allows direct bypassing of the electrical grid by injecting DC current directly into the vehicle’s battery.

What is quite interesting about DC fast charging is that it has several power levels. For example, level 1 provides a power of 80kW, level 2 provides a power of around 420kW. The charging time is then much faster.

## Quick charge
When a sector is in turmoil, innovations are born. This is what is happening in our sector. Fast charging is a bit of a special case and has perhaps the best of both worlds (AC and DC). This fast charge is faster than the DC charge.

Fast charging is a charge mainly used for urgent charging needs. In 15 minutes, it is possible to recharge a car, giving it 200 km of range, but to preserve the life of the battery, this charge stops automatically at 80%.

The particularity of this charge is that it is available in two versions: a DC version that goes directly into the battery and an AC version.

However, for this fast charging to work, the vehicle must be equipped with a type 2 connector. Thus, when charging at a DC terminal, CCS or CHAdeMO connectors are required, which can cause compatibility problems. Unfortunately, this compatibility problem can be a hindrance to the successful deployment of these terminals. Drivers who do not have the connectors may find themselves at a loss when faced with them and feel abandoned.

## Ultra fast charging
This type of charging is the closest thing to “filling up” your car. In 15 minutes, almost 400 km of autonomy is injected into the vehicle’s battery. For the battery to function properly and to preserve its life, the charging stations that deliver this charge operate in a special way.

This is because the charge is first delivered ultra-fast and then very slowly. This preserves the health of the battery. But in order to take advantage of this charge, the vehicle’s battery must be set up in a certain way to accept it.

When using ultra-fast charging stations, supervisory software is used to adjust the charging time of the vehicle.  [The software will automatically adjust the charge](smart-charging) to avoid damaging the battery. The Open E-Mobility solution allows several ultra-fast charge points to be managed at the same time. In this way, the network is not overloaded but, above all, it allows the prioritization of charges and the different needs to be done automatically.

It is now clear that driver behavior and needs will definitely have an impact on the network. Technically, it is not possible to load the network with many simultaneous loads (whether fast or not). This is why Open E-Mobility exists, to provide a solution that allows prioritization of charges and enables charge point providers to manage their network well. At the same time, they also need to ensure that they have different charging points to meet the different needs of drivers.
