Company fleet vehicles are becoming more and more electrified as new vehicles come onto the market. There is an increasing number of electric light vehicles, trucks and buses in the manufacturers’ catalogs. [It is estimated that by 2050](https://electrek.co/2021/10/26/electric-vehicles-projected-to-make-up-31-of-the-global-fleet-by-2050/), electric vehicles will represent nearly 31% of the world’s vehicle fleet.

At present, the thermal vehicles in fleets produce almost 25% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Massive electrification of these fleets can be interesting for companies. Indeed, they will drastically reduce their carbon footprint. Nevertheless, the environmental gains brought by EVs must be qualified because of the overloading of the network.

Forecasts indicate that EV charging is expected to increase energy demand at peak times by almost 10%. Thus, the availability of energy for charging cannot be taken for granted by owners of electric vehicle fleets. This is why it is essential to manage energy management intelligently. This is what we will discuss in this article!

## What is smart energy management?

Intelligent energy management is a digital solution that uses algorithms and operational tools to balance the energy supply of a network. Intelligent energy management allows to manage of the available supply from a network and balancing it according to the demand for recharging electric vehicles and imperative needs such as those of buildings. This is what we offer with our Open E-Mobility solution.

Intelligent energy management is a solution that can be implemented by EV fleet operators. The main advantage of intelligent energy management is the reduction of pressure on the power grid, but there are also economic benefits. It avoids costly grid upgrades that are accompanied by higher charging prices.

## Other benefits for professionals in the sector include

### Managing the request and the response

Whether a recharging infrastructure has 2, 3 or 20 charging points, it is imperative to smooth out the demand throughout the day. [Smart energy management](/smart-charging) allows this to be balanced to avoid over-consumption due to excessive charging demand at peak times.

Over-consumption can be problematic for companies because exceeding the contracted energy supply with the energy supplier can lead to penalties. And the grid operator has to buy even more energy to make up for the shortfall caused by the company. Energy becomes more expensive.

### Exploiting local and renewable resources for resilience and cost savings

Intelligent energy management can also increase load capacity by using renewable energy sources and storage facilities such as wind turbines, photovoltaic panels or batteries. So when prices are too high or demand exceeds what the grid can provide, intelligent energy management comes into play and switches part of the supply to these sources outside the grid. This reduces costs and pressure on the grid.

Open E-Mobility allows the [use of energy sources external](*<?=$rbase?>*/assets-connection) to the grid, so that vehicles can continue to be charged if the main grid fails. In this way, companies gain resilience. Energy that can be stored in local batteries and renewable energy sources will take over. Our solution can also be configured according to company policy to determine priority needs when energy availability is limited.

### Smart Energy Management helps to keep the energy market flexible

Smart energy management is a real economic advantage for EV fleet operators. When demand is too high, prices rise, but with management solutions, it is possible to charge only when demand is low and thus benefit from lower prices. Although this is still at the conceptual stage, it would have a significant impact on the larger grid operators to reduce energy consumption at peak times!

### Supporting a future-ready EV fleet management charging infrastructure

Innovation in the recharging sector is the key to smart energy management, especially for electric vehicle fleets. The concept of V2G (vehicle-to-grid), which allows an electric car to become a mobile battery, can make the grid greener. By making use of the vast decentralized renewable energy storage resources that electric cars potentially provide, the grid can become greener! The V2G concept can feed green energy back into the grid and allow owners to receive compensation for example.

Vehicles in electric fleets spend a lot of time parked and plugged in, making them ideal for V2G participation. Intelligent energy management orchestrates the flow of energy between the vehicle and the grid and between the grid and the vehicle that passes through a charging point, while ensuring that the vehicles in the fleet are ready to go when they need to.

### Intelligent energy management contributes to a greener world

Replacing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with a zero-emission fleet can make a significant contribution to a company’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals – which, in turn, increases brand value. Intelligent energy management, by balancing demand and response, helps organisations avoid increasing their own GHG emissions to meet the increased energy demand associated with fleet EV charging.

By replacing combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles, we contribute to achieving carbon neutrality targets. Some companies that have carbon neutrality as part of their raison d’être may be strongly interested in intelligent energy management solutions like Open E-Mobility. By balancing energy demand, it is possible to help companies avoid over-consumption and increased GHG emissions to meet excessive demand for EV charging.

As EV fleets increase and charging networks become more widespread, intelligent energy management solutions will become indispensable. By contributing to the sustainability of the grid and avoiding blackouts, solutions such as Open E-Mobility also allow companies to make real savings during peak demand and to smooth out different needs.
